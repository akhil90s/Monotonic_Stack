# Monotonic_Stack

- For greater problems, use a monotonically increasing stack (from top to bottom). If we need to pop smaller elements from the stack before pushing a new element.
- For smaller problems, use a monotonically decreasing stack (from top to bottom). If we need to pop greater elements from the stack before pushing a new element.
- For next problems, backwardly iterate through the list and push elements into the stack.
- For previous problems, forwardly iterate through the list.
- For problems with a circular list, iterate through the list twice.
